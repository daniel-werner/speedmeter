# Speedmeter
Speed metering application with MSP430 series microcontroller.

## Introduction
Speedmeter is one of my old pet projects. It is basically a bicycle computer application
written in C using MSP430 series microcontroller. The project is created with a microcontroller
development board using a monochrome lcd from an old mobile phone :-)
Nowadays it sounds funny to create an application like this, but at these days (back in 2010) it was a
real challenge for me to create the prototype of the hardware, and to write the firmware
from the ground up in C language.

## Features
1. Measure the speed of the bicycle
2. Show the speed on the LCD as an analog gauge
3. Save the ride history to the controller's flash memory
4. Customize the device according to the bicycle tire size
